All the files in the src/protocol_t1/ directory comes from Carlos
Prados Towitoko smartcard readers driver.

I (Ludovic Rousseau) hacked the source files a bit to include them in my
CCID driver. So bugs are mine and not Carlos' fault.  As indicated in
the source files headers this code is protected by the GNU Lesser
General Public License.

I used version 2.0.7 of Carlos driver available at
http://www.geocities.com/cprados/

I added the function ATR_GetDefaultProtocol() in towitoko/atr.c
