INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

Installation from source:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

get the ccid-x.y.z.tar.gz archive and do:

$ tar xzvf ccid-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ cd ccid-x.y.z
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default pcscd and my ccid driver use /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ as
directory for hotplug drivers. The ./configure script try to get the
directory used by pcscd using 'pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir'
So you should not have to use the --enable-usbdropdir=DIR argument.


udev use
~~~~~~~~

It is possible to configure the driver to use udev events so that pcscd
will not poll the USB bus every second. Use:

$ ./configure --enable-udev
$ make

You will then have to install the udev rules file in the correct
directory. It could be something like:

$ sudo cp src/pcscd_ccid.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/


On FreeBSD you can also use --enable-udev and add the following rules to
devd.conf (thanks to Tilman Linneweh for the info)

attach 100 {
	device-name "ugen[0-9]+";
	action "/usr/sbin/pcscd -H";
};

detach 100 {
	device-name "ugen[0-9]+";
	action "/usr/sbin/pcscd -H";
};


libusb not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ./configure script says something like:
  configure: error: usb.h not found, use --enable-libusb=PATH
You should use --enable-libusb=PATH to tell ./configure where to find
the usb.h and libusb.so files. The ./configure script will use
PATH/include/ to search for usb.h and PATH/lib/ to search for libusb.so


Binary installation:
""""""""""""""""""""

Contact your distribution support.


Test procedure:
"""""""""""""""

- check the reader is supported by the driver.
  Get your reader USB identification using the lsusb(1) command:
  $ lsusb
  [...]
  Bus 001 Device 048: ID 08e6:4433 Gemplus

  Look for 08E6 (ifdVendorID) and 4433 (ifdProductID) in
  /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist
  Of course your numbers will be different.

  If you can't find them add them (if you know what you do) and/or mail me.

- (re)start pcscd with debug on stdout. Simply do 'pcscd --debug stdout'
  (you will need to have root priviledges). And look for:
  [...]

  ccid_usb.c:131 Manufacturer: Ludovic Rousseau (ludovic.rousseau@free.fr)
  ccid_usb.c:139 ProductString: Generic CCID reader v0.1.0
  ccid_usb.c:143 Copyright: This driver is protected by terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, or (at your option) any later version.
  ccid_usb.c:223 Found Vendor/Product: 08E6/4433 (GemPC433 SL)
  ccid_usb.c:224 Using USB bus/device: 001/047

  If you don't see this the driver is not installed correctly or your
  reader is not yet supported. Read
  http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html#CCID_compliant to know
  what to do.
