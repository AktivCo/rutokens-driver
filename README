USB IFD Handler for RutokenS
====================

  This package provides the source code for a RutokenS driver (IFD Handler).
  The code is generally derived from CCID and OpenCT source code.


Authors:
========

- Aktiv Co <hotline@rutoken.ru>
- Ludovic Rousseau <ludovic.rousseau@free.fr>, author of CCID
- Olaf Kirch for the APDU parsing code, taken from OpenCT.
- Pavel Mironchik <rutoken@rutoken.ru>, Eugene Hermann <e_herman@rutoken.ru>
  for the RutokenS-related code, taken from OpenCT


Supported operating systems:
============================

- GNU/Linux (libusb 0.1.7)
- MacOS X/Darwin (libusb 0.1.8beta, CVS snapshot. See "Known problems")
  to libusb)


Debug informations:
===================

The driver uses the debug function provided by pcscd. So if pcscd sends
its debug to stderr (pcscd --foreground) then the CCID will also send
its debug to stderr. If pcscd sends its debug to syslog (by default)
then the CCID will also send its debug to syslog.

You can change the debug level using the Info.plist configuration file.
The Info.plist is installed, by default, in
/usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/ifd-rutokens.bundle/Contents/Info.plist

The debug level is set in the ifdLogLevel field. It is a binary OR
combinaison of 4 different levels.
- 1: critical: important error messages
- 2: info:     informative messages like what reader was detected
- 4: comm:     a dump of all the bytes exchanged between the host and the
               reader
- 8: periodic: periodic info when pcscd test if a card is present (every
               1/10 of a second)

By default the debug level is set to 0.

You have to restart the driver so it read the configuration file again
and use the new debug level value.  To restart the driver you just need
to unplug all your CCID readers so the the driver is unloaded and then
replug your readers. You can also restart pcscd.
